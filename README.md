# Week-1
This script processes and visualizes image data for an image classification project. It reads image files, converts them to RGB format, and stores them in a DataFrame with their labels. The script then visualizes the distribution of labels using a pie chart.
Data set used for this project is available in kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data/data"
